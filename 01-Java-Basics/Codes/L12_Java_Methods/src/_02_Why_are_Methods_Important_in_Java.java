        /*You might be wondering why do we need methods when we were already implementing
         * our logic in a single simple program. Well, we have the answer!
         * Methods are important because:
         * - Methods allow and enable us to write code once and use it as many
         *   times as we want which means we are not required to write the same code again and again.
         * - Methods are often called time savers because they help you to reuse the existing
         *   code hence saving a lot of your time in re-typing at multiple places.
         * A code created with a method is easy to read and dry run since the code in the
         * method operates separately and can be called whenever needed.*/

        /*
        * Note: Method and function are the same; â€˜method' is the object-oriented term for 'function'.
        * Method, like a function, is a collection of instructions that perform a task, but
        * a method is associated with object(s) but function is not.

        /*
        * For example: Suppose you have to write a program that creates a rectangle and colors it.
        * This can be solved by creating two methods
        * - a method to draw the rectangle
        * - a method to color the rectangle
        * */

        /*
        * Dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks makes your program simple to
        * understand and easy to reuse. In Java,
        * => There are two types of methods:
        * -----------------------------------
        * 1. User-defined Methods:
        *        These are the methods that you create based on the requirements.
        * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        * 2. Standard Library Methods:
        *       These are built-in methods in Java that are readily available to use.
