        //Topic: What are Classes and Objects?

        //1
        //The fundamental elements of OOP are classes and objects.
        //Once we understand these and the way they are used and perceived,
        //we will be equipped with half of the solution-building skills
        // required for any given problem.

        //2
        //A Class is :
        //- User Defined Datatype
        //- It has data member & member functions
        //- It's a logical entity
        //- Classes are the group of object, have common properties
        //- Classes are Template or blue-print from which objects are created

        //2
        //An Object :
        //- It is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behaviour.
        //- It represents a real-life entity.
        //- It is the most basic unit of object-oriented programming.
        //- Object is also identified as an instance of a Class which
        // means that when a class is defined, no memory is allocated but
        // when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

        //3
        //Example: Class and Object: and their attributes and behaviour.
        //Class -> Car
        //    - Attributes : Model, Price, Color
        //    - Attributes : Accelerate(), Break(), Stare()

        //Object -> Tesla Car, BMW Car, Lamborghini Car
        // (1) Object:
        //     Tesla Car :-
        //        1.Attributes :
        //           -> Model : AAA
        //           -> Price : $15K
        //           -> Colour : Gray
        //        1.Behaviours :
        //           -> Accelerate()
        //           -> Break()
        //           -> Stare()

        // (2) Object:
        //     BMW Car :-
        //        1.Attributes :
        //           -> Model : BBB
        //           -> Price : $120K
        //           -> Colour : Black
        //        1.Behaviours :
        //           -> Accelerate()
        //           -> Break()
        //           -> Stare

        /*
        * Here, imagine, Car as a class, with main attributes(identifying elements)
        * such as model, price, color, and build year. We can create as many objects
        * as we want from the Car class. All of these would be Cars but with
        * different attributes such as model, price, color and build year.
        * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
          ----------------------------------------
        * Let us look at another similar example:
        * ----------------------------
        * Class: Vehicle
        * Objects : Car,truck,bike.
        * ---------------------------
        * Here, class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.
        * In this example, Vehicle is a class and Car, truck and bike are objects.
        * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          ----------------------------------
        * Object has three characteristics -
        * ----------------------------------
        * Identity - Unique name of the object
        * State - Attributes of an object
        * Behavior - methods or logic executed on the object
        * ----------------------------------------------------
        * -------------------------------
        * For Example - car
        * Identity - Name of car or model no
        * State - Color, Engine, etc
        * Behavior - car speed, etc
        * -------------------------------
          ---------------------------
        * Characteristics of a class:
        * Class consists of attributes or methods which can be executed by objects(instance of the class)
        * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        * Components of a class : A class needs to have all of these for its existence.
        * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        *    1. Access Modifiers - scope of class where it can be used
        *       -> Java have 4 types of Access Modifiers : 1.Public | 2.Private | 3.Protected | 4.Default
        * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        *    2. class keyword - used to create a class
        * ----------------------------------------------
        *    3. Class name - Name of class
        * --------------------------------------
        *    4. Body - The body of class which consists of attributes, objects, methods and so on
        * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
