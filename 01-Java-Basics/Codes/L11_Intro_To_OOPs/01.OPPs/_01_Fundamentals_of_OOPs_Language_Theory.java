        //Topic : Object-Oriented Programming Concept(OOP)

        //Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming
         //model that organizes software design around data, or objects,
        //rather than functions and logic.

        //OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate
        //rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach
        //to programming is well-suited for programs that are large,
        //complex and actively updated or maintained.

        //Object-oriented approach is said to have been the most successful
        //in handling real world problems.

        //Some benefits of OOPs Language:
        //1.OOP can support large software projects
        //2.Better Data protection
        //3.Code re Usability
        //4.Better Representations of real world object
        //5.Better Software Maintenance
        //6.Enhanced Security
        //7.Easy Code Modification

        //OOP concept works on the principle of considering everything a
        // round as a class and object which has some properties and
        // behavior, which is true for almost everything in the world.
        // You might be wondering now, what are these classes, objects,
        // properties and behavior ? Let us understand it step by step .
